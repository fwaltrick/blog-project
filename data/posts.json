    "teaser": "Scientifically, black is not a color but rather the absence of all colors, occurring when an object absorbs nearly all light wavelengths instead of reflecting them.",
    "content": "<p>When you think about the rainbow, you see a vibrant spectrum of hues: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. But where's black? And why isn't it typically included in our discussions of light and color in the same way as, say, blue or green?</p><p>The simple answer, from a scientific perspective, is that black is the absence of color.</p><p>Think about how we perceive color. Objects have color because they reflect certain wavelengths of light and absorb others. A red apple, for example, appears red because it reflects red light and absorbs most of the other colors in the visible spectrum. White, on the other hand, is what we see when an object reflects all wavelengths of light.</p><p><strong>Black is the opposite</strong>. When an object appears black, it's because it's absorbing nearly all of the wavelengths of light that hit it. Very little, if any, light is being reflected back to our eyes. Without reflected light, there's no color for our eyes to perceive.</p><p>This concept becomes even clearer when we talk about light itself. A prism splits white light into its constituent colors. But you can't split black light into colors, because there is no <span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 194, 102);\">black light</span> in the same way there is white light. In a dark room, where there is no light, everything appears black.</p><p>Of course, in the world of art and pigments, we often talk about \"black paint\" and mix colors to create black. In this context, black is indeed a pigment. However, even then, black pigments work by absorbing most of the light that hits them, effectively removing color from what we see.</p><p>So, while black is undeniably powerful, chic, and fundamental in both our everyday lives and artistic expression, scientifically speaking, it's not a color in the same way red or blue are. It's the ultimate absorber, the beautiful void that makes other colors pop, and the profound absence that allows light to define everything else.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Flowers, with their riot of colors, intricate patterns, and graceful forms, are more than just botanical beauties; they are an endless wellspring of inspiration for designers across various fields. From fashion to architecture, and graphic design to interior decor, the influence of flora is evident everywhere.</p><p>Think about the delicate pleats of a rose petal inspiring the draping of a gown, or the vibrant color combinations of a tropical bloom dictating a bold new palette for a living room. The organic lines of a winding vine can inform the flow of a logo, while the symmetrical perfection of a sunflower's seeds might spark ideas for a repeating pattern.</p><p>Beyond just aesthetics, flowers also offer lessons in functionality and adaptability. Their structures are often optimized for survival and reproduction, showcasing ingenious engineering that can inspire biomimicry in design&mdash;creating solutions by emulating nature's designs and processes.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of flowers, their bloom and fade, can even influence design philosophies, encouraging the creation of pieces that celebrate transient beauty or evoke a sense of fleeting moments.</p><p>Ultimately, flowers remind us that the most profound and beautiful designs often come from the natural world. They encourage us to observe, appreciate, and translate their inherent artistry into our own creative endeavors, ensuring that their timeless charm continues to blossom in countless forms of human design.</p>"

    "teaser": "Discover how distinguishing between the major core and minor supporting details in design creates a harmonious and impactful final product.",
    "content": "<p>In the world of design, you'll often hear about &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor.&quot; These aren't just academic terms; they're a simple way to understand what's most important in a design and what helps it truly shine.</p><p>The major focus in design is the absolute core. It's the central problem you're solving, the main message you're conveying, or the primary function a product needs to perform. If you're creating a new brand identity, the major is designing that iconic logo that will represent the entire company. For a website, the major might be ensuring users can easily achieve their main goal, like buying a product or finding information. This is where the bulk of the creative energy and strategic thinking resides. It's the reason the design project exists.</p><p>Then there are the minor elements. These are all the crucial details that support, enhance, and complement the major focus. They're essential for a complete and polished design, but they don't carry the primary weight of the project's overall purpose. Continuing our examples, for that new brand identity, the minor elements would include the specific typography chosen for marketing materials, the subtle color palette used across different applications, or the style of accompanying imagery. For the website, the minor considerations could be the precise spacing between elements, the micro-interactions when a user hovers over a button, or the tone of voice in the help text. These details refine the user experience and contribute to the overall aesthetic without being the central function themselves.</p><p>The true art of design lies in the harmonious interplay between the major and minor. A brilliant core idea needs well-executed supporting details to be fully realized and impactful. Conversely, even the most exquisite minor flourishes can't rescue a design if its major purpose isn't clear or effective. Understanding this distinction allows designers to prioritize their efforts, ensuring that every element serves its intended role in creating a cohesive and successful outcome. It's about finding that perfect balance where every piece contributes to the overall symphony of the design.</p>"

    "teaser": "An app called Opal finally succeeded at curbing my time spent on social media through a combination of mild friction, encouragement, and guilt",
    "content": "<p>On a recent weekday, I sent an Instagram message to a friend of mine, an art adviser in New York named Stephen Truax, to gossip about an exhibition. Instead of messaging me back in the app, he texted me to say that he'd blocked Instagram on his smartphone during daytime working hours. Impressed, I asked him how he was accomplishing such a feat. Truax said he was using Opal, an app that makes your smartphone a little more like a so-called dumbphone, without requiring you to trade in your device altogether. He said that several of his friends swear by the app, and so he had begun using it, too.</p><p>Opal is not new—its current iteration launched in 2022—but I took this word of mouth as evidence, outside of the app-hype cycle, that it might actually work. I downloaded it without any particular optimism; I considered my phone addiction to be an incurable case.</p><p>Being on the internet too much is an essential part of my job, and a requirement of writing this column. But I'm aware that there's still such a thing as diminishing returns; a doctor doesn't have to personally chain-smoke, for example, to know that cigarettes are bad for your health. When I began using Opal, a few weeks ago, the barrage of online stimulation had become even more cacophonous than usual. It was not just social-media updates; it was video podcasts, live-streaming commentators, and celebrities on press campaigns competing to be perceived through the digital noise.</p><p>The temptation to tune into everything at once was too strong. I could leave my phone in another room, or switch to a flip phone, or try 'launcher' apps, such as Dumb Phone, that convert one's smartphone display into a minimalist set of text-only buttons. But those solutions all rely on self-discipline, which is something I've proved to be short on.</p>",
